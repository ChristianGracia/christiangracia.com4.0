        This site has no font-size declarations in the entire application
        besides pre-defined font sizes in my custom Angular Material theme. I
        made these fonts shrink or grow depending on screen size while most
        sites I see use media queries which causes font-sizes to not shrink or
        grow but a noticeable gap up or down when a certain screen size is
        reached.
